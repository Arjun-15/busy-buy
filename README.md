# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. Please make sure to install npm on your system first.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
Add your Firebase library API connectivity string and configure your Firebase initialization settings in the project.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production in the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

For more information about deployment, see the section on [deployment](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and medium deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you're ready for it.
